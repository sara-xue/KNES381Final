# INTRODUCTION #

Welcome to my KNES 381 Final Project Website! I used the template: [Beautiful Jekyll](README_Template.md), and added my own posts, images, and content related to what I learned this semester.

Once you go into the [Website](https://sara-xue.github.io/KNES381Final/), the home page will show posts related to what I did this semester like **Excel**, **video analysis using Dartfish**, and my **Scratch maze game**. Please look through everything and enjoy!

# Website #

## About Me ##
The [aboutme.md file](aboutme.md) can be changed to add info about yourself and will show up as a page under the "about me" tab on the website. I gave a quick overview about myself and added some photos!

## Homepage ##

If you click the profile picture or "KNES 381 Final Project" (in the top left corner), it will bring you to the homepage. This page can be edited via the [config.yaml file](_config.yml). This is where you can change the header and font colour, as well as add a profile picture, and different links to the website.

## Posts ##

Posts can be created in the _posts_ folder will all follow the same format-- a title, subheader, date posted, and tags that can be added. Posts will show up on the Homepage and can be clicked into and around (next, previous post).

# More Information #

Check out the [README_Template.md file](README_Template.md) for more information as to how to specifically make changes to the website. This README is just a quick and broad overview!
