This website will include my own data related to Kinesiology (charts, video analysis, and graphics). I hope you enjoy!!


### My story

I am a 4th year Kinesiology student who enjoys exercising, finding new places to eat, and drinking coffee. I love going hiking in the mountains during the summer time so I am excited for the weather to get warm again.
I also love [cats](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/domestic-cat) and hope to own one in the near future!!
