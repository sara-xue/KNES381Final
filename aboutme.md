This website will include my own data related to Kinesiology (charts, video analysis, and graphics) based on some computer applciations and techniques that I have learned over the course of this semester. I hope you enjoy!!


### My story

I am a 4th year Kinesiology student who enjoys exercising, finding new places to eat, drinking coffee, and taking pictures of everything and anything. I love going hiking in the mountains during the summer time so I am excited for the weather to get warm again.
I also love [cats](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/domestic-cat) and hope to own one in the near future!!

Here's a fun collage of some tasty meals/snacks that I've had recently. (if you click on the images, it will take you to the file on my github repository in case you're interested)
