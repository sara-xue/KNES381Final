## Video Analysis using MyJump and Dartfish Express

Below is a video of myself doing a countermovement jump (CMJ) using the MyJump app. The video was analyzed (text/angles/edits added) with the use of the Dartfish Express application on my phone.

## Dartfish Analysis

Upon performing the countermovement jump in the video above, I can see where I can improve. 
* In **screen capture 1** (Starting position), my stance looks good as my feet are shoulder-width apart and my legs are straight (preparing to squat and jump). My hands are also placed on my hips so the jump is mostly targeting lower body power (my arms will not be swinging to give myself more power).
* In **screen capture 2** (Take-off position), my stance generally looks good as well since my legs are squatted to build up the power for the jump. Since the video is taken from the ventral perspective (not side), the analyzed angles may not wholly reflect how bent my legs are. Regardless, for future jumps, it may be of benefit to squat lower *(but not too low, maybe try to get to a 90 degree bend in the knees)*. The hands on hips can also help with balance.
*  In **screen capture 3** (Jump height), this is the tallest height I reach (the furthest up from the ground). At this point, my legs have straightened out, and my hands are still on my hips.
*  Lastly, in **screen capture 4** (Landing), this is when my feet first touch the ground. My legs have bent again coming down so as to better dissipate the ground reaction forces being applied to the body.

## MyJump Analysis
MyJump is an application that can calculate individuals' jump height through collection of leg length, 90 degree leg length (squat position), weight, take-off, and landing data. A video is taken of the individual performing the jump and they will then have to manually go through the video to determine the frame their feet just leaves the ground, and the frame their feet just touches the ground. 

Based on the video above, my jump height came out to be 23.47 cm.

## Significance of this analysis
Jump height is something I would like to work on! I enjoy playing volleyball but my physical height (in addition to my jump height) is lacking. So upon more practice with jumping I may better be able to set and serve the ball. Moreover, jump height may be an [indicator of power (lower body power), so by improving my height I may be able to in turn improve my power as well](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00231/full) (which can be beneficial for all sorts of other sports I can partake in).
