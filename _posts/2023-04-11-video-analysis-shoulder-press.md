Many workouts I perform invovle functional strength training (see: [a collection of my workouts](https://sara-xue.github.io/KNES381Final/2023-04-08-excel-spreadsheet-data/)).
But I never actually look at myself when I do the exercises -- I just do what feels right and essentially hope for the best (hope that msucle is being built).
This is not the best way to perform exercises as I could be doing them completely wrong and might be injuring myself instead!
Therefore, below is a video analysis of me doing some dumbbell shoulder presses, and what I should change.

## Analysis ##
* In **Screen Capture 1**, my form is not great- my arms are fairly bent and there is asymmetry in my shoulders (left side dumbbell is held slightly lower than right side).
* In **Screen Capture 2**, the lowering down of the dumbbells (eccentric movement) is not correct. The upperarm/elbow should be at 90 degrees with my trunk, and parallel to the floor. I will need to work on not lowering my elbows down as much. I am also extneding my wrist backwards when I hold the dumbbell so I need to strengthen my wrist muscles when lowering the weights.
* In **Screen Capture 3**, my form looks better when bringing the dumbbells back up (concentric phase) to start another rep. My elbows are less bent (but not completely straight either), but the range of motion looks better.
