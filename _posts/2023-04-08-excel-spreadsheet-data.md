I have been going to the gym more often starting in February 2023. I would like to use this website as a means to document my fitness journey. I will be updating this post monthly with new statistics and graphs depicting various fitness variables. Here is a [link](https://github.com/sara-xue/KNES381Final/files/11184303/Workouts.2.csv) to an excel spreadsheet that will contain exported data from my Apple Watch Fitness App. 


Below, I have also included histograms of my active energy from February and March-- where we can observe increased active energy in March compared to February. Hopefully this trend will continue to increase as the months progress throughout this year.

I also wanted to look at my average heart rate (HR) trends throughout each of my workouts for these last two months, so below are two scatterplot graphs showing it. As I workout more, and do more cardio (my walking workouts on the treadmill are cardio for sure), I am expecting to have a lower average HR because my heart will be healthier and thus will not need to pump blood as much/as hard. Unfortunately, there was no resting HR data that was exported from my apple watch so I will have to manually measure my resting HR at various times during a month (in the future) to see if it is decreasing as well over time.

I am looking forward to continuing my fitness journey!
