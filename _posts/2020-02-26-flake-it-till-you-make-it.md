I have been going to the gym more often starting in February 2023. I would like to use this website as a means to document my fitness journey. I will be updating this post monthly with new statistics and graphs depicting various fitness variables. Below is a link to an excel spreadsheet that will contain exported data from my Apple Watch Fitness App. I have also included histograms of my active energy from February and March-- where we can observe increased active energy in March compared to February. Hopefully this trend will continue to increase as the months progress throughout this year.
